- Syncing colouring changes, and when navigating into and away from EyePaint

- Eraser button, I've added a separate select and unselect eraser svg to make it clear when you've selected the eraser.
It seems tricky to implement, I was thinking when you select the eraser it paints sections white. But you need to account
for the fact that they could've selected a colour to paint with so then you kinda have 2 things selected and it doesn't make
sense. Also, you need to somehow make the eventListener (for each section) listen for both the eraser and colouring in.

- The SVG xml is hard-coded in the variable 'svgString'; need to find a way to get this data automatically.

- Styling improvements maybe since it's quite plain rn.

- Screen to select different images.

- Formatting as always... a lot of hard-coded pixel values, so it's not responsive to different screen sizes.

- Music/sound effects.

- Note: right now it saves your drawing as long as you stay in the Eye'm'Home app.
