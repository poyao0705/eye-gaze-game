Todo
- The SVG xml is hard-coded in the variable 'svgString'; need to find a way to get this data automatically.

- Screen to select different images.

- Remove hard-coded pixel values so it'sto different screen sizes (mostly done)

- Music/sound effects.

- Background sometimes doesn't cover the whole page (I think issue is on clinician side)

- Reset button functionality

- Back button functionality

- Make colour palette fit in more by adding an image
